Example codes from the book of Joshua Keviersky: Refactoring to Patterns (http://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/).

The baseline for all of the patterns (i.e. the "wrong, or to-be-refactored state") is on master.
Each pattern is in it's own folder.
Each of them is a separate Maven module. 

The solution, is on each branch, named similarly as the folder. 
You can easily compare them using github's compare tool on the branch. 

Good luck, hope it helps, give me a comment if you found it useful! 

Cheers,
Balint
